Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies-abstraction
and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other.

Basically, in Bridge pattern we need to divide large hierarchy into two independent parts. 
The main hierarchy will use another (e.g. Shape object uses Color object), and the client code could easily work with all the variations of two hierarchies.
Also we could easily expand the main hierarchy withouth changing the dependent object.
