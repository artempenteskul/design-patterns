Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies-abstraction
and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other.

=====

The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
It is used to decouple an abstraction (such as an interface or an abstract class) from its concrete implementations.
This separation allows you to change or extend the abstraction and implementations independently without affecting each other.
