Adapter is structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

=====

The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them compatible without changing their source code.
This pattern is especially useful when you have existing code or third-party libraries that you want to integrate with new code without modifying the existing code.
