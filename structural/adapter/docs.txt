Adapter is structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Basically, the main goal of this pattern is to make incompatible interfaces compatible. In python, we can use multiple inheritance for this.
For example, we have the clients code which could operate only with XML data and the library which could operate only with JSON data. 
In this case we can easily add the Adapter class which will "translate" the data for library from XML to JSON and return us needed result.
The clients code in this way will operate with Adapter class instead of library, and Adapter class inside will use the library for its needs.
