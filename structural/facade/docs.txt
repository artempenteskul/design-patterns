Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

=====

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex systems.
Making it easier for clients to interact with the system and hiding the implementation details of its subsystems.
It promotes decoupling, organization, and maintainability while enhancing security and access control.
The Facade is particularly valuable when dealing with complex systems with numerous components or when integrating with external libraries or services.

=====

Components of the Facade Pattern:

Facade:
This is the central class or interface that clients interact with.
The Facade provides a simplified, unified interface to a set of complex subsystem components.
It hides the complexity of the subsystem and shields clients from the details of its implementation.

Subsystems:
Subsystems are individual classes or components that perform specific tasks or functions.
These are the underlying classes or components that the Facade coordinates and uses to fulfill client requests.
