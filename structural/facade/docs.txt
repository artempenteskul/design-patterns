Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

Facade basically helps to hide some hard logic and provide easy and simple Interface (Facade) to the client_code.
In this case, we don't have mess with our own classes and the classes of additional library or framework.
We also can create Additional Facade objects to divide the responsibilities and tasks between Facades.
