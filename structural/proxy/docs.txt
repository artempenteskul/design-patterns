Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

Basically, Proxy is an additional layer before request from client to RealSubject, which could handle different operations (access, logging, caching, etc).
To implement pattern we need to create basic interface (Subject) from which we will inherite our RealSubject (service) and Proxy.
After that in client code we could use as Proxy as our actual service (RealSubject).
Proxy, inside its implementation should definitely redirects the requests to our RealSubject object (actual service).
