Factory method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in the superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

=====

The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to determine the class to instantiate.
This pattern defines an abstract factory class that encapsulates the creation of objects and delegates the responsibility to its subclasses.

=====

The Factory Method Design Pattern consists of several components:

The Creator abstract class, which defines the factory method that returns a Product object. The Creator may also define other factory methods to create other related objects.
The ConcreteCreator classes, which implement the factory method and return a specific type of Product object.
The Product abstract class, which defines the interface for the objects that the factory method creates.
The ConcreteProduct classes, which implement the Product interface and define the concrete objects that the factory method creates.
The typical workflow of the Factory Method Design Pattern is as follows:

=====

The client code creates a ConcreteCreator object.
The client code calls the factory method on the ConcreteCreator object to create a ConcreteProduct object.
The ConcreteCreator object creates a ConcreteProduct object and returns it to the client code.
The main advantages of the Factory Method Design Pattern are:

=====

It encapsulates object creation and provides a flexible way to create objects.
It allows for the easy addition of new types of objects without changing the client code.
It promotes loose coupling between objects and improves maintainability and scalability of the code.
Overall, the Factory Method Design Pattern is a useful pattern to use when creating objects that have complex initialization requirements, or when the client code needs to be decoupled from the object creation process. It provides a flexible and scalable way to create objects and is widely used in software development.
