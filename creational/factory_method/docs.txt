Factory method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in the superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

=====

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory Method pattern defines an abstract Factory class or interface that specifies a method for creating objects,
and allows subclasses to implement that method to create different types of objects.

=====

The Factory Method pattern is useful when you want to provide a framework for creating objects,
but you don't want to specify the exact class of object that will be created until runtime. 

This can be useful when you have a set of related classes that share a common interface,
but you want to allow clients to create instances of those classes without having to know their exact implementation.

=====

The Factory Method pattern can also be used to encapsulate object creation in a single class, which can help to simplify code and improve maintainability.
By using a Factory Method, you can centralize object creation logic, which can make it easier to change the way objects are created without affecting the rest of your code.

=====

To implement the Factory Method pattern, you would typically create an abstract Factory class or interface that defines a method for creating objects.
Then you would create one or more subclasses of the Factory class or interface, each of which implements the createObject() method to create a different type of object.
Clients would then use the Factory class to create instances of the objects, without having to know the specific implementation details of the objects themselves.
