Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 
The pattern allows you to produce different types and represantations of an object using the same construction code.

=====

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different representations.

=====

The main idea of the Builder Design Pattern is to use a separate object, called the "builder," to construct an object step by step.
This way, the client code can create different representations of the same object using different builders.

=====

The pattern consists of several components, including:
The Builder interface, which defines the methods that must be implemented by all builders.
The ConcreteBuilder classes, which implement the Builder interface and provide specific implementation details for constructing a particular object.
The Director class, which controls the construction process and uses the Builder interface to build the object.
The Product class, which represents the complex object being built.
The typical workflow of the Builder Design Pattern is as follows:

=====

The client code creates a Director object and a ConcreteBuilder object.
The client code passes the ConcreteBuilder object to the Director object.
The Director object controls the construction process by calling the methods of the ConcreteBuilder object in the required sequence.
The client code retrieves the constructed object from the ConcreteBuilder object.

======

The main advantages of the Builder Design Pattern are:
It allows for the creation of complex objects without exposing their internal structure to the client code.
It provides better control over the construction process and allows for the creation of different representations of the same object.
It simplifies the code and makes it more modular and easier to maintain.
Overall, the Builder Design Pattern is a useful pattern to use when creating complex objects that require a specific construction process and have multiple representations.
