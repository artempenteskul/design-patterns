Abstract Factory is a creational pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

=====

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
This pattern allows you to create families of related objects without specifying the concrete classes of those objects.

=====

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern consists of several components:

The Abstract Factory interface, which declares a set of factory methods for creating abstract objects.
The Concrete Factory classes, which implement the Abstract Factory interface and create a family of related objects.
The Abstract Product interface, which declares a set of methods for interacting with the abstract objects created by the factory.
The Concrete Product classes, which implement the Abstract Product interface and define the concrete objects created by the factory.
The typical workflow of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern is as follows:

=====

The client code creates a Concrete Factory object.
The client code calls the factory methods on the Concrete Factory object to create a family of related Concrete Product objects.
The Concrete Factory object creates a family of related Concrete Product objects and returns them to the client code.
The main advantages of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern are:

=====

It provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
It promotes loose coupling between objects and improves maintainability and scalability of the code.
It allows for the easy addition of new families of related objects without changing the client code.
Overall, the Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a useful pattern to use when creating families of related objects.
It provides a flexible and scalable way to create objects and is widely used in software development.
