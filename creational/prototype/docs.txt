Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

=====

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of objects based on existing objects through cloning.
The main idea of this pattern is to avoid the high cost of creating new objects by copying existing objects.

=====

The Prototype Design Pattern consists of several components:

The Prototype interface, which defines the clone() method that all concrete prototypes must implement.
The ConcretePrototype classes, which implement the Prototype interface and provide a concrete implementation of the clone() method to clone themselves.
The Client class, which creates and manages the prototypes.

=====

The typical workflow of the Prototype Design Pattern is as follows:

The client code creates one or more ConcretePrototype objects and stores them in a PrototypeManager.
The client code retrieves a ConcretePrototype object from the PrototypeManager and calls its clone() method.
The clone() method creates a new object and copies the properties of the existing object into the new object.
The client code uses the cloned object.

=====

The main advantages of the Prototype Design Pattern are:

It reduces the number of classes needed to create objects and improves performance.
It provides a simple way to create objects with different initial states without changing the code.
It allows for the creation of complex objects without having to know their internal details.
Overall, the Prototype Design Pattern is a useful pattern to use when creating objects with different initial states that share a common structure.
It allows for easy cloning of objects and reduces the need for creating new objects, which can be particularly useful in resource-constrained environments.
