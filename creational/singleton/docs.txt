Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to the instance.

=====

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
This pattern is used when a single instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

=====

The Singleton Design Pattern consists of a single component:

The Singleton class, which has a private constructor and a static method that returns the single instance of the class.

=====

The typical workflow of the Singleton Design Pattern is as follows:

The client code calls the static method of the Singleton class to get the instance of the class.
The Singleton class creates the single instance if it does not exist, or returns the existing instance to the client code.

=====

The main advantages of the Singleton Design Pattern are:

It provides a global point of access to a single instance of a class.
It ensures that only one instance of the class is created, even in a multi-threaded environment.
It reduces the memory footprint of an application by avoiding the creation of multiple instances of a class.

=====

However, there are some disadvantages of the Singleton Design Pattern as well:

It can be difficult to test, as it can interfere with other parts of the system.
It can be misused, leading to overuse and decreased maintainability of the code.
Overall, the Singleton Design Pattern is a useful pattern to use when a single instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across a system.
It provides a convenient and efficient way to manage resources and avoid duplication of objects.
