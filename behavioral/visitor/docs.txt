Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code.

=====

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate the algorithm from the object structure it operates on.
It enables you to add new operations to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves.
This pattern is particularly useful when you have a complex object structure and want to perform various operations on the objects without having to modify their classes.

=====

Key components of the Visitor pattern include:

Visitor:
This is an interface or an abstract class that defines a set of visit methods, one for each type of element in the object structure.
These visit methods take the elements as parameters and encapsulate the specific algorithms to be applied to them.

Concrete Visitor:
These are the concrete implementations of the Visitor interface.
Each concrete visitor provides the actual implementation for the visit methods.
You can have different concrete visitors for different operations on the object structure.

Element:
This is an interface or an abstract class that defines an accept method.
This method takes a visitor as a parameter and allows the visitor to access and operate on the element.

Concrete Element:
These are the concrete implementations of the Element interface.
Each concrete element class implements the accept method, allowing a visitor to visit and perform specific operations on the element.

Object Structure:
This is a collection of elements, which may vary in types.
It provides a way to traverse and visit its elements.
It typically has methods to add elements and accept visitors.
