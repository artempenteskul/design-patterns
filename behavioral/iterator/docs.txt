Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.
Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single iterator interface.

The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of that collection.
It separates the process of accessing the elements from the actual structure of the collection, making the code more flexible and decoupled.
