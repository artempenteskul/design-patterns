Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

=====

The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in the form of a template or a skeleton of an algorithm.
It allows subclasses to provide concrete implementations for certain steps of the algorithm while keeping the overall structure and order of the algorithm intact.
This pattern promotes code reuse and ensures that certain steps in the algorithm are consistent across different implementations.

=====

Key components of the Template Method pattern include:

Abstract Class:
This is the core class that defines the template method, which is the algorithm's structure.
The abstract class may also include abstract methods that represent steps in the algorithm that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

Concrete Class:
These are the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.
Concrete classes provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
They customize or override specific steps of the algorithm as needed.
